/**
 * Module to desugar all loops to while loops. This requires
 * the following transformations to be done:
 *
 * This plugin must enforce the following assumption about loops:
 *
 * Loop bodies are BlockStatements:
 * Loops can have an ExpressionStatement for their body. This messes
 * up the anf pass since it tries to added the complex named expression
 * to the nearest statement. In this case, the statement will be
 * outside the body of the for loop, effectively hoisting them outside
 * the function body. To fix this, the body of all loops should a statement.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 *
 *   1. The program only has while loops.
