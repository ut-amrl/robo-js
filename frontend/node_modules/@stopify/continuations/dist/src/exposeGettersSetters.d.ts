/**
 * This transformation allows for getters and setters support in stopify.
 * Getters and setters are implicity called on object accesses. This
 * transform makes it such accesses explicit:
 *
 * Getters: a.b        => $gs.get_prop(a, "b")
 * Setters: a.b = v    => $gs.get_prop(a, "b", v)
 * Delete:  delete a.b => $gs.delete_prop(a, "b")
 *
 * The functions simply access the property. The benefit of making this a
 * function call is that it allows a getter to capture itself.
